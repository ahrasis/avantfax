Installing AvantFAX
---

You can use the rh-install.sh script for RHEL5, CentOS 5, and Fedora Core 4 and better.  Similar scripts are available for SLES 10 (sles-install.sh) and Debian (debian-install.sh).  Please send suggestions directly david at avantfax.com.


NOTE: Only run the script once or risk adding duplicate configuration settings to sudoers and the HylaFAX configuration files.

The rh-install.sh does the following:

- Installation of all required packages via yum
- Updates PHP PEAR libraries
- Configures HylaFAX's JobFmt and faxmail for AvantFAX
- Installs AvantFAX files
- Configures Apache virtual hosting for AvantFAX
- Disables SELinux for Apache, allowing you to leave SELinux enabled on your server
- Creates the AvantFAX MySQL user and database
- Symlinks the AvantFAX faxrcvd and notify scripts to HylaFAX's $SPOOL/bin
- Replaces HylaFAX's faxcover with AvantFAX's faxcover
- Configures sudo
- Configures HylaFAX $SPOOL/etc/config and $SPOOL/etc/config.tty* to use AvantFAX's custom scripts
- Automatically adds any configured HylaFAX modems to AvantFAX's database
- Sets up root's crontab for the AvantFAX housekeeping scripts

There is another script for configuring Email to FAX.  For details, see email2fax.txt
