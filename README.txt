AvantFAX is a web based front-end for the HylaFAX fax server software.  It was developed with Object Orientated PHP and MySQL.  This will allow administers to use a browser to manage users, their permissions, fax lines, categories, etc; and will allow users on any platform to view and send faxes while on the local network or away from the office.

AvantFAX was written by David D. Mimms, Jr. <david(at)avantfax.com>
