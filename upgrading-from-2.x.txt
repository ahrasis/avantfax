** IMPORTANT **

1) If you're upgrading from a version prior to 2.2.6, you must apply all of the database patches from your version to 2.2.6.  If you download the latest 2.x series of AvantFAX, it will have all of the required db-update-*.sql files.  BACKUP YOUR DATABASE BEFOR YOU BEGIN!

mkdir ~/faxbackup
cd /var/www/avantfax
mysqldump --user=avantfax --password=d58fe49 avantfax > ~/faxbackup/db_backup.sql
cp -ru includes/local_config.php faxes/ ~/faxbackup

** Attention **

All of the following commands are already prepared for you in a script called "upgrade-from-2.3.sh".  Run it only ONCE!

2) You must update your database schema with the db-update-300.sql file included in this package

mysql -uavantfax -pd58fe49 avantfax < db-update-300.sql
mysql -uavantfax -pd58fe49 avantfax < db-update-302.sql
